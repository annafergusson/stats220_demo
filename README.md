# stats220_demo

This is my demo repo for STATS 220. 

*I will use this for demonstrating various STATS 220 related teaching things.*

Are you one of my students?

- Feel free to follow me
- Feel free to watch this repository
- You can even ⭐ the repo if you want 

You can also check out my [demo website!](https://annafergusson.github.io/stats220_demo/)

This README file is intentionally boring. It could probably do with some images, or more emoji 😺
